/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operators:
 *    - Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
 *    - The most common assignment operator is the = operator, which assigns the value to the declared variable. 
 *    - Other assignment operators include +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, and **=.
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic Operators:
 *    - Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.
 *    - Common arithmetic operators include + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), ** (exponet), / (dividde), % (modulus), ++ (increment), -- (decrement).
 *    - The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. This is usually used to check if a number is even or odd.
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operators:
 *    - Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean value (true or false).
 *    - Common comparison operators include == (equal to), === (equal value and type) != (not equal to), !== (not equal value or type)
 *  > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators:
 *    - Logical operators are used to detrmine the logic between variables or values.
 *    - The three logical operators are && (and), || (or), and ! (not).
 *    - The logical AND returns true if both operands are true, the logical OR returns true if at least one operand is true, and the logical NOT returns the opposite value.
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operators:
 *    - Unary operators operate on a single operand.
 *    - The unary ! (logical NOT) operator changes the boolean value.
 *    - The unary typeof operator returns a string that represents the data type.
 *    - The unary - operator creates the negative value.
 * 
 * 6. Ternary Operator:
 *    - The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a way of writing an if statement.
 *    - It takes three operands: a condition followed by a ? symbol, an expression to evaluate if true, and another expression to evaluate if the condition is false.
 *    - It returns the value of either the true expression or the false expression based on the condition.
